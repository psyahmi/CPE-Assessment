# CPE-Assessment
This project builds an end-to-end fine-grained image classification system to identify flower species using the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset. It applies transfer learning with a pre-trained model, data augmentation for robustness, and explainability techniques to ensure accurate and interpretable predictions.
